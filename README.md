# Reproducing Results: Sample-Size Induced Bias in Confusion-Matrix Metrics

To replicate the results from this paper, please ensure you are using Python 3.11. Follow the steps below:
1. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Execute the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
- If you encounter any issues during installation, a `pip_freeze.txt` file is available, which lists exact package versions. To use these, set up a clean Python 3.11 virtual environment and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r pip_freeze.txt
    ```
